bash stuff
I am working on a bash shell script (or series of) that will harden RHEL/Rocky Linux 8+ to a certain standard. Next I would like to do Ubuntu and then SUSE Linux. I would eventually like to make this something that can ensure all operating systems (or at least as many as possible) can help make the average user more safe. In my head, I call it "PRISM". There is raw light coming in and out comes the different flavors of linux that are as secured as possible for vanilla installations.
